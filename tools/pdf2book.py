"""Convert text-based PDFs into MPG1 .pgs book files for the Muon Bench e-reader.

Usage:
    python3 tools/pdf2book.py                 convert every PDF in books_src/
    python3 tools/pdf2book.py a.pdf b.pdf     convert the named PDFs

Flags:
    --title "..."   override the book title (only valid with a single input)
    --out DIR       output directory (default data/books)

The pagination contract lives in SPEC.md: 54 columns by 37 rows, monospace,
on the portrait 680x920 canvas. Every line this script emits is at most 54
characters and every page holds at most 37 lines, so the firmware can render
lines verbatim with no wrapping.

Only text is extracted. Images are skipped inherently. A scanned PDF with no
text layer produces an empty book; run OCR on it first.
