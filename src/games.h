// in the firmware (www/dist, see platformio.ini board_build.embed_files), the
// ROMs under GAMES_ROM_DIR and the save files under GAMES_SAVE_DIR. All
// emulation happens in the browser; the reader only stores bytes. The same
// page adds books (a .txt is paginated on the device, a .pgs is stored as is)
// and deletes them. The HTTP
// contract is documented in SPEC.md ("Games server"). The radio is off when
// this returns.
