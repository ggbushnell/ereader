// Feed sync.
//
// Walks NEWS_FEEDS in include/config.h, which holds one row per endpoint: the
// news brief (slug "news", a plain text BOOK feed) and the daily numbers (slug
// "numbers", a JSON NUMBERS feed). All of them are fetched over a single WiFi
// association. A BOOK feed is paginated on the device with the same rules the
// host converter uses (src/text_paginate.cpp) and written to
// /books/<slug>.pgs, so it shows up in the library like any other book. A
// NUMBERS feed is stored verbatim at NUMBERS_FILE for src/numbers_view.* to
// draw. Every body is streamed to a LittleFS temp file, so nothing larger than
// one paragraph is ever in RAM: the 78 KB page buffer the panel needs leaves
// no room for a 200 KB download.
//
// NVS namespace "news", one key pair per feed (see config.h for the exact
// names, feed 0 carries the unsuffixed pair):
//   "etag"   String, the ETag of what is currently on the device. Sent back as
//            If-None-Match, so an unchanged feed costs one 304 and no download.
//   "stamp"  String, "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" (UTC) taken from the response's Date
//            header. Shown in the menu header and in the library entry.
//   "auto"   bool, sync once at boot. Default false. One flag for all feeds.

// BOOKS_DIR/<slug>.pgs, using `blobFile` as scratch. `pagesOut[v]` is the page
// count of variant v. Leaves `textFile` alone and the reading position alone.
